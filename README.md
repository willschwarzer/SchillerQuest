### Overview:
Schiller Quest is a turn-based and text-based RPG. The player moves their character through a gridded level space, defeating monsters and acquiring new loot and abilities. In its current state, Schiller Quest has a functional GUI interface that outlines the design of the game. The game currently consists of a title screen, a primary level screen in which the player can navigate, and an inventory screen showing the items in the player's possession.
