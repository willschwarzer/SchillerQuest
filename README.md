## Overview:
Schiller Quest is a turn-based and text-based RPG. The player moves their character through a gridded level space, defeating monsters and acquiring new loot and abilities. The goal of the game is to get as far in the dungeon as possible. As you progress through it and defeat monsters, you will become more powerful and gain more powerful equipment; but be careful! The monsters will also become stronger and stronger.
